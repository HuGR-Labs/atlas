// @atlas/adapter-io — src/governed-emit.ts  (COMPOSE-A: the governed durable emit leg)
//
// The runtime composition-root's governed write door. `atlas-emit` persists DURABLY only THROUGH the
// governed path — three fail-closed gates, in order, before a single byte is written:
//   1. TRUTH DOOR   — the GROUND truth-gate: a node whose grounding does not re-derive FRESH is rejected
//                     (`emitted:false`), nothing persisted (TOOLS-7b / GROUND-6).
//   2. AUTHZ        — the KNOW-11 owner-scoped write gate (`actorInScope`): an actor not in the fact's
//                     scope is rejected, nothing persisted. An empty/unset actor is in NO scope ⇒ every
//                     write is denied (fail-closed v1 — correct behavior).
//   3. UPSERT+PUT   — route the write through the proven KNOW-15 `upsert(WriteRequest)` decision (mirrors
//                     the CLI `mine.ts` durable-write path), persist the projection sidecar durably, AND
//                     `store.put(node)` the WHOLE GroundedFact into CAS so the content-addressed bytes ARE
//                     the fact (driftFacts / doctor read them back — the INVARIANT).
//
// Pure of clock/random: no wall-clock, no nonce, no counter enters the decision. This composes OVER the
// frozen core (`@atlas/tools` emit, `@atlas/knowledge` upsert, the GROUND gate) — it re-implements none.
